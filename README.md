# Aviation Emergency Locations

This repository contains a non-exhaustive list of potential emergency landing spots in and around Hamburg. To raise awareness for the general scarcity of landing location and help in locating those that do exist, this list has been created. It should be noted, however, that this collection is not officially endorsed by anyone!

We do not suggest that you do land in any of these locations nor do we endorse landing on a particular persons property. It is not our intention to direct potential harm anyones way.
