To simulate this behaviour, E.L.S.A. uses a concept from geometry which Lester Eli Dubins fortunately figured out some {dubinsPathAge} years ago.\n\nOn the right you can see a plane that follows the blue line. However, it had an engine failure and wants to divert towards the location depicted as a green line at the top. To reach it with the minimum height loss, it takes two turns at the maximum comfortable, configurable bank angle with a straight segment in between — in this case roughly resembling a base leg. Keep in mind that while the picture on the right shows a traffic-pattern like approach, this may not always be the case. E.L.S.A. always assumes the shortest possible path.\n\nWe highly recommend reading up <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubins_path\" external>on what constitutes these</a> mathematically proven shortest paths from one location and heading to another.

Note that this also takes into account that some locations, like the one on the right, may only be approachable in one direction due to e.g. power lines.\n\nThe keen reader may have noticed that in the previous section, we had an aircraft heading to work with. However, when plotting a range profile, we do not necessarily know the heading your aircraft will be flying in advance. For this reason, E.L.S.A. calculates the <em>worst</em> possible heading at each location and uses that. Best case, it gives you a little bit of headroom when you are already facing towards the location. Worst case, you have just the right height when heading away.\n\nIf you are interested in how the range profile looks without a threshold, take a look at <a href=\"/guide/rangeGraph.gif\" external>this mesmerizing piece of art</a> we generated while developing the tool."
