Welcome to the E.L.S.A. Handbook! This guide encompasses a multitude of topics for you to read. It
starts off with an introduction into the base-concepts applied within all the tools, then it gives
detailed explanations of every tool provided with everything you should know to interpret the data
correctly. Lastly, we have compiled information from a number of external sources which might be
helpful in an emergency situation.
