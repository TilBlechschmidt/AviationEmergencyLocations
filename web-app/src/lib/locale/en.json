It is a percentage of the distance required to come to a full stop: At <code>0%</code> you come to a complete stop at the end of the usable length, <code>100%</code> means you have double the required length. At <code>-15%</code> headroom you miss a couple of meters and will over-run the usable length.<br><br>For the purpose of risk categorization, two thresholds are defined which determine the category based on your currently selected aircraft.
